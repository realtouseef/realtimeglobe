Features Section (Grid of 6 Cards, Scroll-Triggered – From datafa.st & zerotoshipped's Feature Grids)
Content: 2x3 responsive grid (or staggered on mobile). Each card: Icon (e.g., 🌍 for globe), title, 2-3 bullet benefits, micro-screenshot/gif (e.g., avatar popup).
Cards: Real-time 3D Viz (60fps arcs/points), Live Avatars (DiceBear styles, smart zoom), Session Details (clickable popups with city/OS), Revenue Dashboard (counters + est. earnings), Aggregated Stats (referrers/flags/devices), Event Log (color-coded feed: New Visitor 🟢, Conversion 🟡).
Opener: "Why RealtimeGlobe? Turn traffic into a visual story."

Why? Builds on zerotoshipped's columned features (core/UI/backend) and datafa.st's analytics breakdowns—focus on revenue/user journey like Marc Lou's tools.
Aesthetics: Glass cards with subtle hover glow; fade-in on scroll; purple accents on icons.

Themes & Customization Showcase (Carousel or 3-Side-by-Side – Unique to RealtimeGlobe, Nod to zerotoshipped's Tech Stack)
Content: Horizontal carousel (swipe on mobile). Each slide: Live globe preview in theme (Minimal: abstract dark; Night: city lights; Day: blue marble), one-liner ("Minimal: Clean dashboards • Night: Global connectivity glow"), and config props (e.g., atmosphereColor: #3a228a). Below: "25+ Avatar Styles" grid (DiceBear previews: adventurer, bottts, etc.).
CTA: "Preview & Customize" (toggles live demo).

Why? Highlights your GlobeConfig flexibility—like zerotoshipped's integrations list—while keeping it visual and playful.
Aesthetics: Blurred backgrounds per theme; smooth swipe transitions.

Founder Section (Personal Bio Block – Directly Inspired by All Three Sites' "Hey, It's Me" Vibes)
Content: Centered image (your photo or avatar, e.g., DiceBear style) + bio card.
Headline: "Hey, I'm Touseef – Built from Karachi with ❤️"
Story: "As a dev in Pakistan (@touseefcodes on X), I've shipped tools that make data delightful. RealtimeGlobe started as my weekend hack to visualize my site's traffic in 3D—now it's helping indie hackers worldwide turn analytics into art. Follow my builds on X (10k+ followers) or join the convo."
Creds: "Powered by Three.js, Globe.gl, Tailwind • Open-source on GitHub • Built 5+ micro-SaaS (e.g., [link past projects if any]) • $X earned bootstrapped."
CTA: "Tweet me your globe @touseefcodes" (share button).

Why? Essential for trust—like Kitze's creds in zerotoshipped, Marc Lou's "fired from school → $2M" arc in datafa.st/codefa.st. Humanizes the tool, encourages shares (building in public). Personalize to your Karachi roots for relatability.
Aesthetics: Warm accent (e.g., subtle Pakistan flag emoji 🇵🇰 or Karachi skyline glow); light glass overlay on dark bg.

Social Proof / Testimonials (Marquee or 4-Grid – From codefa.st & datafa.st's Quote Walls)
Content: Horizontal scroll of 4-6 quotes (real or placeholders):
"Addicted to watching my users globe-trot – switched from GA instantly! – Indie Hacker, $500 MRR SaaS"
"Beautiful revenue viz that clients love sharing – 10x engagement. – Marketer @ AgencyX"
Include metrics: "Tracking 10k+ visitors daily • 200+ stars on GitHub."
If none yet: "Early adopters raving on X" with embedded tweet previews.

Why? Echoes codefa.st's student wins ("$400 MRR in 3 weeks") and datafa.st's "Best tool in 14 years"—proves value for skeptics.
Aesthetics: Quote bubbles with avatar icons; auto-scroll like a live event log.
